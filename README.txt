Here is how to get the plots and data:

Requirements:
1. Make sure you have Python as a command.
2. Make sure you have numpy and matplotlib Python environments.
3. Make sure you have other modules installed.
    Run the code and see what is missing.


Steps:

# Go to the sources directory
cd sources

# Run the code by typing
python generate_data.py

Note: The time to run the code depends largely on the size of the graph.
